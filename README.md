Literature Review: Trade Dependency of ASEAN States on China (2016-2022)
 
Introduction:
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China stand as a developing interwoven economic relationship, especially between the period 2016 to 2022, but we see the strong ties between ASEAN states and China since long. Completing the Investment Agreement, alongside existing agreements on goods and services, would solidify the ACFTA.A review of the Trade in Goods Agreement further emphasized the importance of this trade relationship, with ASEAN-China trade reaching nearly half of all Asian trade in 2007. These points collectively suggest a deepening economic connection between ASEAN and China, potentially leading to increased trade dependency for ASEAN states. This paper reviews existing literature on the trade dependence of ASEAN states on China, focusing on some preliminary drivers, such as the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), infrastructure development under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and foreign direct investment (FDI) from China.
The ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) has played a pivotal role in enhancing market access and trade liberalization between ASEAN countries and China, driving significant economic integration and cooperation. This trade agreement has effectively lowered trade barriers, leading to increased trade flows and investment between the regions. Furthermore, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has made substantial contributions to infrastructure development, boosting connectivity and reducing transportation costs. A 2008 meeting between ASEAN economic ministers and China's commerce minister revealed a rapidly growing trade relationship. The value of trade between the two regions tripled from 2003 to 2007, reaching $171.1 billion. This significant growth, averaging 30% annually, was driven by both exports (28% increase) and imports (32% increase) from China. Discussions also centered around finalizing the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) by December 2008, (ASEAN Secretariat, 2012). These improvements have not only facilitated greater trade volumes but also attracted significant foreign direct investment (FDI) from China, which has been instrumental in driving economic growth within ASEAN countries.

Moreover, China's heavy reliance on the Strait of Malacca for trade creates a strategic vulnerability known as the "Malacca Dilemma." This narrow waterway handles a significant portion of China's oil, LNG imports, and overall trade. The lack of viable alternatives for these resources exposes China to potential blockades, especially concerning the perceived threat from the US Navy's presence in the region.
The Malacca Dilemma has a ripple effect on China's trade relations. Firstly, it fuels China's push for energy security by diversifying sources and investing in renewable energy. Secondly, India's strategic position in the Indian Ocean adds another layer of complexity, potentially hindering China's response to any disruptions in the Malacca Strait. Finally,China's ambitious naval modernization program can be seen as an attempt to counter potential threats to its vital trade routes.
Looking towards the future, China prioritizes securing Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs) like the Malacca Strait.This control is seen as a stepping stone to achieving superpower status and breaking free from the perceived encirclement imposed by the US and its allies. In conclusion, the Malacca Dilemma significantly influences China's trade relations,driving them towards energy diversification, military buildup, and potentially tense geopolitical maneuvers.
We try to cover these dimensions and, in the process, provide an all-around perspective on the fast-changing trade dynamics and economic linkages between the ASEAN countries and China. This study is based on the gravity model. The literature review covering the period from 2016 to 2022 highlights the deepening of economic ties and interdependence between ASEAN and China. The ACFTA has facilitated market access and trade liberalization, while the BRI has enhanced connectivity and reduced trade costs. Chinese FDI has driven economic growth, increased production capacities, and deepened trade interdependence. The regression model used in this study reveals that economic size, population, and manufacturing investment flows are significant determinants of trade dependency. The ongoing implementation of the ACFTA, the expansion of BRI projects, and the continuous flow of Chinese FDI are likely to further strengthen the relationship and economic integration between ASEAN and China in the foreseeable future.

Background of ASEAN-China Trade Relations
First Trade Relationships
ASEAN and China's economic relationship dates back one century and has become highly formalized in the past few decades. At first, trading activities were of little concern as ASEAN countries focused more on trading with the Western economies and Japan. However, since then, China's rapid economic rise and strategic pivot towards Southeast Asia have fundamentally altered this dynamic.
Creation of ACFTA The most crucial landmark in the trade relationship between ASEAN and China occurred in 2010 when the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) was formed. To attain a more liberal and competitive market environment and remove the tariff on many subjects to promote deeper integration of respective economies, the agreement laid a path toward heightened trade flows. The agreement set a tone for remarkable developments from 2016 to 2022.
Monetary Agreement of ASEAN INTERPOL 2016-2022
The increase in trade volumes:
In these six years from 2016 to 2022, the ASEAN-China trade relationship has deepened, as data from ASEANstats.org show. As the bilateral trade volume continued to register increases between these two areas, a common interest in economic goals and strategic partnerships became visible. The trade value in total between ASEAN and China was going up, and exports and imports moved upward. Countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines became the key players in this trading dynamic. Among them, it was Vietnam that recorded the most significant trade volume with China.
 
Key Exports:
The primary goods traded between ASEAN and China have been electronics, machinery, textiles, and agricultural products. Notably, there have been surges in the trade of electronics and machinery, which signify the industrial complementarities between the two regions. China exports mainly high-value electronics and machinery, while ASEAN countries export a mix of raw materials, intermediate goods, and finished products to China.
 
Factors Leading to Trade Dependency:
ACFTA - ASEAN China Free Trade Area
The agreement has also facilitated the reduction of trade barriers between ASEAN and China, thus enabling each to gain more access to the other's market. It also encourages economic integration and cooperation by reducing tariffs on a wide variety of products. Evidence-based studies have shown that trade flow between ASEAN economies and China has expanded considerably and deepened mutual interdependence since ACFTA came into operation. Indeed, with trade liberalization under ACFTA, there will be facilitation of growth in regional value chains, and it will help deep integration of ASEAN nations into the global economy.
Economic Integration
The ACFTA has also strongly facilitated economic integration between ASEAN and China. First, it has provided a more level competitive field, encouraging companies to spread out and invest in new markets. This has led to regional value chains in which production processes are dispersed between countries. That enhances interdependence and economic cooperation.;
Infrastructure Development: The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
First, implemented in the year 2013, the BRI of China has been effective in the promotion of infrastructure connectivity between ASEAN and China. Its main objective is to construct a giant railway, highway, seaport, and pipeline system, which will greatly enhance the efficiency of transport networks and cut the cost of carrying goods across borders. There has been strong evidence from several studies that BRI-related infrastructure projects have spurred considerable trade flows between ASEAN and China, fostering economic cooperation and integration.
For example, the establishment of the China-Laos Railway and the China-Thailand Railway had improved the ways of trade routes, enabling the operation of more convenient and efficient movement of goods.
Make trade more cost-effective
The BRI has been progressively lowering the cost of trade between ASEAN and China. The initiative has resulted in improved infrastructure connectivity, ensuring that goods can move seamlessly, and this has witnessed a reduction in the cost of transportation and its duration. This made the trade cheaper; hence, businesses could trade more efficiently, with more trade flow and investment. Studies show that developing BRI-related infrastructure has significantly increased trade between ASEAN and China, stimulating economic cooperation and integration.
 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from China
Stimulating Economic Growth:
Chinese FDI is the critical driver of ASEAN Countries' economic growth and industrial cooperation. Between the year 2016–2022, China has also become one of the leading investors in the ASEAN region, more especially in the manufacturing business. From a series of data reported by ASEANstats.org, it is suggested that Chinese FDI in ASEAN reached $86 billion during the stated period. The largest share has been claimed by the manufacturing sector—23%.
This has accelerated economic growth and boosted production ability and industrial cooperation, leading to the consolidation of trade interdependence.
Promoting Industrial Cooperation:
The Chinese FDI has, therefore, also fostered industrial cooperation between ASEAN and China. Key sectors where Chinese companies have increased investment are manufacturing, infrastructure, telecommunications, and energy, among others. These have heightened capacity in production and industrial development and fostered industrial development in ASEAN countries. It has also developed regional value chains in which production processes are divided across nations, thus enhancing regional economic integration and cooperation.


 
The Extent of Interdependence and Economic Linkages
Business Value Assessment:
The values shown in the trade reflect highly interdependent relations between ASEAN and China. For the regression model in the study, a solid positive relationship was noted between the FDI from China, the GDP, and the population size against the trade value gap. This relationship between the variables and trade dependency is solid from the high levels of statistical significance in the model, as denoted by the F-statistic of 85.94 against an extremely small p-value of 0.0000.
The results suggest that economic growth, population size, and Chinese FDI are significant predictors of the trade value gap, which underlines the deep economic interdependence.
The sector analysis further amplifies the deepening economic ties between ASEAN and China. The manufacturing sector accounts for the most significant percentage of the highest Chinese FDI recipients and hence speaks to the strategic importance of industrial cooperation. Also emerging is large-scale Chinese investment in other sectors, such as infrastructure, telecommunications, and energy, which ushers in comprehensive economic integration. Such investments in regional value chains have facilitated the development of trade linkages and financial interdependence.
Developments in Changing Trade Realities
Impact of ACFTA on Liberalization of Trade:
The ACFTA has provided a foundation for the liberalization process of trade between ASEAN and China. Some studies show that the reduction effect in tariffs with the ACFTA has made a significant increment in trade flows, hence economic integration and cooperation growth. The same development of regional value chains allows ASEAN to become more integrated into the global economy.
According to research, the full implementation of ACFTA would lead to further increases in liberalized trade and economic integration over the years.
BRI as a Driver for Connectivity:
This has changed with the BRI regarding the connectivity and amount of it between ASEAN and China. The infrastructure expansion under the BRI has increased trade logistics and reduced transportation costs, consequently enhancing trade flow and investment. There is much to be sought in the future as BRI projects will continually enhance connectivity and trade relations. Evidence from research indicates that BRI infrastructure development has robustly raised trade levels within ASEAN and China, thereby boosting economic cooperation and integration.
Meaning of Chinese FDI:
Chinese FDI has become one of the drivers for economic growth and industrial cooperation in ASEAN countries. Investment inflow has been associated with economic development, increasing production capacity, and fostering industrial cooperation that further deepens trade interdependence. Studies have shown it to play a significant role in promoting economic integration and collaboration between ASEAN countries and China. It is expected that the inflow of FDI from China will continue to have financial ties and trade relations strengthened in the years to come.
Based on data from ASEANstats.org and the World Development Indicators, yielding extensive information on trade values, FDI, GDP per capita, population of the ASEAN countries, and so on; this is in the period 2016–2022 to look at the different components of trade dependency and economic interdependence between ASEAN and China.
 
Gravity Model of Trade:
The gravity model, first proposed by Jan Tinbergen in 1962, suggests that the scale of bilateral trade between any two countries is proportional to their respective GDPs and geographical distance. The classical trade gravity model is: 
1.        Tij=A(GDPi×GDPj)DistijTij=ADistij(GDPi×GDPj)
where TijTij is the bilateral trade flow, GDPiGDPi and GDPjGDPj are the GDPs of countries i and j, A is a constant, and DistijDistij is the geographical distance between i and j. 
The log-linear form of the model is: 
2.        lnTijt=β0+β1lnGDPit+β2ln⁡GDPjt−β3ln⁡Distij+ϵijlnTijt=β0+β1lnGDPit+β2lnGDPjt−β3lnDistij+ϵij
To study the factors influencing China-ASEAN trade, the model is extended to include additional variables such as population size, resource endowment differences, exchange rates, land area, and dummy variables for the Belt and Road Initiative and free trade agreements.
The gravity model of trade, which has been found to forecast bilateral trade flows depending on the respective economic sizes between two units and distance, is quite helpful in studying the trade relationship between ASEAN and China. The gravity model suggests that trade grows with respective sizes and dampens as the distance increases. 
The regression analysis reveals a positive relationship between GDP flows and trade value, indicating that trade growth between ASEAN countries and China is linked to economic development. Additionally, population size and Chinese FDI show a positive relationship with trade value, highlighting their significance in increasing trade dependency. Economic growth, population size, and Chinese FDI significantly influence the trade value gap, underscoring the deep economic interdependence between ASEAN and China.
Trade Potential
The study also assesses the trade potential between China and ASEAN countries using the trade potential model. The trade potential index categorizes trade relationships into three types: great potential, potential development, and potential reshaping.
●	China-Vietnam Trade Potential: The trade potential between China and Vietnam falls into the category of potential reshaping, indicating that both sides are utilizing their trade potential to the greatest extent possible. Trade growth space is limited, and new trade opportunities must be discovered to sustain trade growth.
●	China-Other ASEAN Countries Trade Potential: The trade potential index between China and the remaining nine ASEAN countries (excluding Vietnam) falls into the potential-exploiting category. This indicates that the trade potential has not been fully utilized, and there is still room for growth in the scale of trade between China and these countries.
 
Trade Liberalization under ACFTA
The findings suggest the importance of continuous trade liberalization under ACFTA. ASEAN and China should expand market access and economic integration by reducing tariffs and eliminating trade barriers. Policymakers should enhance the coverage and depth of ACFTA to include new sectors and services, promoting comprehensive economic integration and cooperation. Additionally, developing BRI-related infrastructure should focus on improving trade logistics and reducing transportation costs, fostering higher trade and investment volumes.


Enhancing Infrastructure
The BRI, while showing potential, has been changing the course of infrastructure development by boosting trade connectivity. This is the responsibility of policymakers, and the development of BRI-related infrastructure should be geared toward improvements in trade logistics and the reduction of transportation costs. High-level ASEAN-China connectivity will promote high trade and investment volumes, leading to further economic growth and integration.

Promoting Industrial Cooperation
The regression analysis conducted in this study shows a positive relationship between GDP flows and trade value, indicating that trade growth within ASEAN is closely linked to economic development and increased trade with China. The findings underscore the importance of economic growth, population size, and Chinese FDI in enhancing trade dependency between ASEAN and China. Specifically, Chinese FDI has been a critical factor in promoting industrial cooperation and economic development, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing, infrastructure, telecommunications, and energy. This investment has bolstered production capacities and deepened economic interdependence, further strengthening trade ties.
Policy implications from these findings suggest a need for continued efforts towards trade liberalization under the ACFTA. Both ASEAN and China should focus on expanding market access and economic integration by reducing tariffs and eliminating existing trade barriers. Policymakers must strive to broaden the coverage and depth of the agreement to include new sectors and services, thereby fostering comprehensive economic cooperation and integration. Moreover, infrastructure development under the BRI should prioritize enhancing trade logistics and reducing transportation costs to improve overall trade efficiency and connectivity. High-level ASEAN-China connectivity will likely lead to higher trade and investment volumes, driving further economic growth and integration.
The role of the digital economy in ASEAN-China trade relations is becoming increasingly significant. E-commerce, digital payments, and online services have streamlined trade processes, reducing transaction costs and improving market access, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The adoption of digital technologies has facilitated smoother and more efficient trade flows between the two regions. Future research should focus on the impact of digitalization on trade dependency and economic integration, examining how technological advancements are shaping trade relationships and contributing to economic growth.
Global economic policies and regional trade agreements also play a crucial role in shaping ASEAN-China trade relations. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes ASEAN, China, and other Asia-Pacific countries, aims to create the world's largest free trade area. This multilateral agreement is expected to further liberalize trade and promote economic integration within the region. Future research should explore the impact of such agreements on trade dependency, economic integration, and the broader dynamics of international trade relations. Understanding the interplay between regional and global trade agreements is essential for comprehending their effects on the trade dependency rate between ASEAN and China.
Environmental and social considerations are increasingly important in the context of international business. The infrastructure projects under the BRI and Chinese FDI in ASEAN countries have significant environmental and social impacts that must be considered. Future research should examine these impacts to ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of environmental degradation or social inequalities. Policymakers should align trade and investment policies with sustainable development goals, promoting environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive growth. This alignment is crucial for ensuring the long-term viability and positive impact of ASEAN-China economic relations.
In conclusion, trade with China has deepened significantly between ASEAN and China from 2016 to 2022 through strategic partnerships, trade liberalization, infrastructure development, and investment flows. The dynamic trade relationship between the two regions indicates increasing interdependence and economic linkages. This literature review underscores the importance of continuous research and analysis to understand the intricate and evolving trade relationship between ASEAN and China. The findings highlight the need for policymakers to focus on trade liberalization, infrastructure development, digital economy advancements, and sustainable development to foster a mutually beneficial and deeply integrated economic partnership. Future research should continue to explore the various dimensions of ASEAN-China trade relations, considering the impact of digitalization, global economic policies, environmental and social factors, and the evolving global trade landscape.

The graph above shows the positive current total trade- China FDI relationship using a scatter plot with the trend line on log-log scale. Findings also show that nations having large overall trade introduced, have even larger FDI from China. According to the positioning of the trend line, one can observe that the relation between two variables is exponential, meaning that change in one variable is proportional to the other. However, readers need to understand that this graph has some forms of limitations that need to be pointed out. However, we cannot unfavorably conclude that the relationship is causal - the increase in trade may lead to the creation of Chinese FDI or the other way round. Also, the use of the scatter plot helps in noting the difference between the actual resultant or trend line and the exceptions. There can be instances where several countries may have higher trade volume but lower FDI or vice versa. More general information that would be useful for designing a more detailed view of the topic include data source, more specific information about the country, and any other factors that could reasonably affect China’s decisions about FDI (such as political stability, resources, and labor costs). In conclusion, it is possible to say that, given the data, a positive relationship between total trade and China’s FDI might be expected on a log-log scale, though deeper investigation and context analysis should be conducted to identify the exact nature of correlation.

This graph presents a compelling view of trade trends, showcasing two lines: 
The horizontal axis represents “Total Trade” from the period of 2016 to 2022 while on the vertical axes is “Trade With China”. Notably, this can be seen through the total trade line, which shows an increase in the general flow of trade. However, the construct ‘Trade With China’ shows a contour that can be presumed as a higher level of steepness, thus suggesting a higher propensity toward a more increased trade particularly with China. About the trade partner of the country it is evident from the graph that it is now turning into an important trade partner of china.
